# Releasing

- Run `npm run release <version>` where `<version>` is in the form `major.minor.patch`.
- Publish a new release named `<version> release` [here](https://github.com/mobile-dev-inc/action-maestro-cloud/releases/new) to the Actions marketplace. Tip: use the `Generate release notes` feature to get a great changelog filled out automatically.
- That's it! The command above will build and push the appropriate artifacts and tags to deploy the action.
